---

WaveTek represents a paradigm shift in decentralized finance, combining cutting-edge cryptographic research with practical DeFi applications to deliver institutional-grade privacy without compromising on performance or usability. Our privacy-preserving DEX aggregator leverages zero-knowledge cryptography, multi-party computation, and advanced blockchain engineering to create a truly confidential trading environment.

## Technical Architecture Overview

WaveTek's architecture is built upon three fundamental pillars: cryptographic privacy, high-performance execution, and cross-chain interoperability. Each component is meticulously engineered to provide seamless user experience while maintaining the highest standards of security and confidentiality.

## Privacy Model Deep Dive

### Transaction Confidentiality

WaveTek ensures complete transaction confidentiality through multiple layers of cryptographic protection:

- **Amount Encryption**: All transaction amounts are encrypted using homomorphic encryption
- **Stealth Addresses**: Each transaction generates unique one-time addresses
- **Graph Anonymity**: Transaction graph analysis is prevented through mixing techniques
- **Temporal Privacy**: Transaction timing information is randomized within bounds

### MEV Protection Mechanism

Our Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) protection system prevents front-running, sandwich attacks, and other forms of transaction ordering exploitation through:

**Technical Approaches:**
- **Commit-Reveal Schemes**: Users commit to transactions before revealing amounts
- **Threshold Encryption**: Transaction details are encrypted until execution time
- **Fair Ordering**: Randomized transaction ordering with cryptographic guarantees
- **Fee-based Priority**: Pure fee-based ordering prevents MEV extraction

**Performance Metrics:**
- **MEV Prevention Rate**: 100% (no successful MEV attacks detected)
- **Additional Latency**: &lt;10ms overhead for protection mechanisms
