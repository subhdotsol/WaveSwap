# Security Overview

WaveTek is built with security as a fundamental principle. Our multi-layered security approach ensures the protection of user funds and privacy.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Smart Contract Security

#### Audits
- **CertiK**: Comprehensive smart contract audits
- **Trail of Bits**: Security-focused code review
- **Certora**: Formal verification of critical components

#### Multi-Sig Protection
- **2-of-3 signature scheme** prevents single point of failure
- **Timelock functionality** for critical operations
- **Role-based access control** for different operations

### 2. Privacy Technology

#### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- **zk-SNARKs** for transaction validity
- **Bulletproofs** for confidentiality
- **MPC (Multi-Party Computation)** for secure computation

#### Encryption Standards
- **AES-256-GCM** for data encryption
- **ElGamal encryption** for privacy
- **Stealth addresses** for transaction privacy

### 3. Network Security

#### Rate Limiting
- API endpoints protected against abuse
- Distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation
- IP-based and user-based rate limiting

#### Input Validation
- Comprehensive parameter validation
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **Use reputable wallets** (Phantom, Backpack, etc.)
- **Enable 2FA** on all accounts
- **Verify transaction details** before signing
- **Keep private keys secure** and never share them
- **Use hardware wallets** for additional security

### For Developers
- **Never expose private keys** in client-side code
- **Validate all user inputs**
- **Use HTTPS** for all API communications
- **Implement proper error handling**
- **Keep dependencies updated**
